        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>One day, LonelyL went to see a doctor to try and find out why they were bald. The doctor told LonelyL that they had a condition called alopecia areata, which causes hair loss. The doctor explained that alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder, which means that the body's immune system mistakenly attacks hair follicles, leading to hair loss.</p>
        <p>LonelyL was relieved to finally have an answer, but they were also sad to learn that there is no cure for alopecia areata. The doctor told LonelyL that there are treatments available that can help slow down hair loss and stimulate hair regrowth, but they may not work for everyone.</p>
